  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our applet, we want to introduce three basic kinds of sort method: Bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort. We aim at displaying each step and each loop in different sorts through our applet. Users can see how variables are changed and how the array are changed in each step.</p>
  <h3>Client: </h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Roger R. Flynn
  <h3>Goal:</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our survey before the final project, we find java beginners are always confused how to sort an random array by different sort methods. Based on the result of our survey, we decide to build an applet to introduce three basic kind of sort methods in a detailed way. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We show how different kinds of sort methods work in a very straightforward way. The applet mainly is divided into 5 parts. Users can generate a random array in the "array input" panel, then they can choose which sort method they want to learn. By clicking buttons in "Functional Buttons"panel, they can see the result in the "Execution Result" panel and "Explanation Window" panel.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed instructions for using the applet will be showed in the <a href="instruction.html">instruction page</a>.</p>
